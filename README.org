* Elasticsearch client and query DSL for Haskell

** Stability

Bloodhound is alpha at the moment. The library works fine, but I don't want to mislead anyone into thinking the API is final or stable. I wouldn't call the library "complete" or representative of everything you can do in Elasticsearch but being personally familiar with multiple clients in other languages I think the story there is good.

* Examples
